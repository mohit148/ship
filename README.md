# ship.

A little community "ship" board for a Discord server — friendships, chaotic duos, and yes,
the occasional couple. Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase, and
Discord OAuth.

## What's here right now

The frontend is fully built out and matches the reference design closely — pastel status
badges, thin borders, soft shadows, avatars, sidebar nav that collapses to a bottom bar on
mobile.

**Supabase is the source of truth once it's configured.** Every page and API route calls a
function in `lib/data/*.ts` (e.g. `getShips()`, `getUsers()`) or checks
`isSupabaseConfigured()` directly. If Supabase is connected, that's what you see — including
a correctly empty list, if a table has no rows yet. The local JSON file — `.dev-store.json`
at the project root (see `lib/data/dev-store.ts`) — is only used when Supabase isn't
configured at all, or a query genuinely fails (bad keys, network error). That means clicking
Approve, ending a ship, editing custom text, etc. actually persists across refreshes even
before you've set up Supabase. Delete `.dev-store.json` any time to reset back to the sample
data.

The backend scaffolding — Supabase schema, RLS policies, Discord OAuth flow, session
cookies, and every API route (ships, requests, admin actions) — is written and wired for
consent-first ship creation.

**If you already ran an earlier `supabase/schema.sql`:** don't rerun it — run
`supabase/migrations/0003_backgrounds_avatars_manual_people.sql` instead (safe to run more than once).

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL editor, run `supabase/schema.sql`. It creates `users`, `ships`,
   `ship_requests`, `ship_history`, `reports`, `audit_logs`, plus RLS policies.
3. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (Project Settings → API)
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (same page — keep this secret, server-only)

## 3. Set up Discord OAuth

1. Create an app at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Under OAuth2 → Redirects, add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/discord/callback`
   (and your production URL later).
3. Fill in `.env.local`:
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/discord/callback`
   - `ADMIN_DISCORD_IDS` — comma-separated Discord user IDs that should get admin access
   - `SESSION_SECRET` — any long random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`)

## 4. Run it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Consent rules, as implemented

- **2-auth ships** (the "Send a Request" flow) only become `confirmed` once the *recipient*
  accepts — see `app/api/requests/[id]/route.ts`. Sending a request never creates a ship by
  itself.
- **Admin-created ships** start as `pending`, not `confirmed` — an admin creating a ship is
  not the same as both people consenting. Wire up whatever confirmation step fits your
  server (a Discord DM with a button, a "confirm this ship" page) before flipping it to
  `confirmed`.
- **Custom text on 2-auth ships** is proposed by one participant and held in
  `custom_text_pending` until the other confirms it — see the `PATCH` handler in
  `app/api/ships/[id]/route.ts`.
- **Ending a ship**: either participant on a 2-auth ship can end it themselves; ending an
  admin-created ship requires an admin. Ended/archived ships are never deleted — their
  history stays in `ship_history`.

## Known gaps to close before shipping (heh) to production

- `lib/data/*.ts` fetches related users with a second query (by ID) rather than a single
  joined query — this sidesteps needing to know Supabase's exact auto-generated foreign key
  constraint names, at the cost of an extra round trip per page. Fine at this scale; revisit
  if it ever shows up as a bottleneck.
- `lib/supabase/types.ts` is hand-written for reference and isn't wired into the clients
  yet (hand-rolled `Database` types can produce confusing `never` errors with supabase-js's
  generics unless every field is present). Run `npx supabase gen types typescript` once
  your project is linked, then parameterize `createClient<Database>()` in
  `lib/supabase/client.ts` / `lib/supabase/server.ts`.
- The mobile top bar's "Login" link and admin toggle switches on the Settings page are
  visual/functional placeholders — hook them up to your real auth state and a `settings`
  table respectively.
- No automated tests yet.
