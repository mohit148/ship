            ship. is a little board for tracking the pairs that make up this server — best friends,
            chaotic duos, running bits, and yes, the occasional couple. Most ships here are just friends.

              <li>• Log in with Discord and send someone a request — they have to accept it.</li>
              <li>• Or ask an admin, who&apos;ll check with both people before creating it.</li>
              <li>• A ship never becomes public just because one person set it up.</li>

              Your data isn&apos;t sold or used for anything unrelated to this site. Discord login only helps us identify
              your Discord account and access basic information such as your display name and avatar. Logging in also
              unlocks additional features, like creating and managing your own ship cards and requests.

              You don&apos;t need to log in just to appear in a ship — an admin can create a ship using basic information
              instead.

            Something look wrong, or want a ship removed? Ping an admin in the server and they can sort it
            out from the dashboard.
